		 *

		 * up in the previous step. By not specifying any other configuration
		 * methods (like `.random()`, `.color()`, etc.), you are relying on the
		 * default values predefined in the PerformanceTest class.
		 * 
		 * - The agent will play 1 match (default matches value). 
		 * - It will have a timeout of 500ms for each move (default timeout value). 
		 * - The agent's chosen color will be "red" (default color value). 
		 * - The game will be set at difficulty level 0 (default difficulty). 
		 * - The logging to the terminal will have a default verboseness (LogLevel.DEFAULT)

		 * 4. The agent will play 10 matches.
		 * 5. Each move of the agent has a timeout of 500 milliseconds.
